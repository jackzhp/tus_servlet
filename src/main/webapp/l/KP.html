        list all EKP's without ELevel.
        and for each EKP, we can present their desc, and their ETest.
        we can decide to merge any two of them, or delete any one of them,
        or set(change) ELevel for any one of them.


        there is no point to list EKP's without ETest.

        given a ELevel(usually a course), list all of its EKP's.
