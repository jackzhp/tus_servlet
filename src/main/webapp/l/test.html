        list ETest's without any EKP.
        so we can add EKP to it. 

if this is what intended, then this page is not needed, this can be embedded into player.html
</pre>

        this page, list all tests for for a given ELevel.
          of course, we can associate EKP's with ETest's. but the key point is the ETest's for a given ELevel.
          
          and ETest can be designed(added) on this page.
